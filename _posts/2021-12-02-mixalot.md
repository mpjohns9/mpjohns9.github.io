With a group of three other students, I programmed a Franka Emika Panda robot to 
mix and serve drinks. By interpreting a userâ€™s order, the robot determined
the correct combination of ingredients, selected the correct ingredients, 
and served the requested drink. My contribution focused on computer vision and 
verbal order processing.  

<h5 style="font-family:montserrat">Computer Vision</h5>   

Using an Intel Realsense camera, I implemented a computer vision algorithm to detect 
the ingredient bottles by color, so the robot would know which ingredients to pick up.
This algorithm was further used to detect when an order had been filled by detecting 
cups in the order waiting area.  

<h5 style="font-family:montserrat">Voice Processing</h5>  

Using the vosk ROS package, I was able to implement an algorithm to process a customer's
order verbally. Using a state machine, the robot would respond to a customer depnding
on their input. Once a valid order was given, it would be processed and passed to the node 
that handled the robot's movement.
